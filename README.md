<h1>FSGR</h1>
<p>The intention is to have a separate page for each gaming category with each review being collapsed on the page with the newest first.  Each one can then be expanded to view the content for each review.  In addition we would like to have an admin page where a review can be submitted with the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Category selector.</li>
<li>Publish date.</li>
<li>HTML field for review content.</li>
<li>Media selector.</li>
<li>Reviewer name.</li>
</ul>
